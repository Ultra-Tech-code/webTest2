i am the guy who created the ariithmetic library that wasn't changing the state
My contract wasn't changing the state... so i had extra feature to the code and this is the transaction hash
0x9a5796e3fe359c5e6c65042501b51677f122e4cf040034ace69f4260c5c334f3
contract address: 0x0E51551541dd553f12da0368aF498a2E06b0d144


i was having issues on my hardhat stating... usdt address is not a contract address so after the class, i have to switch
off my laptop and run it again
and it run perfectly well,

the screenshot of my errors and my output and the later result have been applied this document.


note: WETH doesn't have a balanceOf function but so the value remain 0 but the usdt balance reduced
after the transaction.

Thank you.
